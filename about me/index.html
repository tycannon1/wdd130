        Hello! My name is Ty, I am from a small town in Idaho. I love running as well as I like to travel!
        I am a videographer and photographer studying Web Development at BYU Idaho. I used to be a software
        major but switched wanting to focus more on web. I took a javascript class last semester so Im excited
        to connect the two now!
