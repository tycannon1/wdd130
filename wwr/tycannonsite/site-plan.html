        Why will people come to my site?
People will come to my website to feel inspired and motivated to take part in learning about travel and destinations I have been to and find out the ways I go about traveling. 
In the past I have shared content of unique places and experiences to where I have traveled. People have always reached out through messages and emails to find out information on these places, with a website in place I can share that information in one spot for everyone to see! 

Visitors for my site will be aided by social media growth, When viewing my social media they can be directed to my website to find out more information. The appeal from my photographs and visual media will create an aesthetic on the website that will hopefully be enticing and pleasing to the eye, that will also help users gravitate towards my site. 

Business/Monetize
With giving recommendations and information about places to visit I hope to one day be  able to monetize the content I post about on the website and get revenue from travel companies or businessâ€™s selling products that I use. I can also receive revenue from ads put up on the website and if the website leads people to other social networks I can monetize on there as well.

      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2
This part of my website will include all the media of the places I have traveled sort of as a photo gallery with trip information. I will also provide links for people to connect with the businesses I use for travel. This page may also include an amazon store front or some sort of recommendation page not only for travel but for potential products, which could eventually turn into my own store front.

      <h3>Video/Photo</h3>

This page will be mainly a contact page for contracted work. I am contracted out to do photography and videography, so this part of the website will include samples of the content that I have created and also information on booking me for contracted work. These types of media include work for businesses or for personal events.
